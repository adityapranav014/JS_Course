                                         Identifier
->Identifier are those names that help us in naming the elements in JS
Example : firstName
          lastName
          placeOfVisit

                                         Rules
1. First character of an identifier should be letters of the alphabet or an underscore(_) or dollar sign($)
2. Subsequent characters can be letters of alphabets or digit or underscore(_) or dollar sign($)
3. Identifiers are case-sensitive
4. Reserved Keywords cannot be used as Identifiers


                                         Types of Identifiers
             Scope         Declaration                  Assignment
1. let       Block         Redeclaration not allowed    Re-assignment allowed
2. const     Block         Redeclaration not allowed    Re-assignment not allowed
3. var       Function      Redeclaration allowed        Re-assignment allowed  


                                          NOTE
1. Use let keyword for identifier declartion that will change their value over time 
   or when you don't need the variable outside the code block
   or when you are looping, and looping variables are never used outside the block
2. The const declaration can be used for string type identifiers
   or simple number, functions or classes which does not need to be changed
3. Use var keyword for variable declarations when you want them to have global scope in the program.
